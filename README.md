💓 Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect the presence of heart disease using a supervised machine learning model — Logistic Regression. It uses medical parameters such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The model supports early diagnosis through evaluation and visualization.

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm Model Used: Logistic Regression

Why Logistic Regression? Logistic Regression is effective for binary classification problems, easy to interpret, and performs well when features are linearly separable.
